# FaunalRecoveryCode
Code of the analysis and figures for the manuscript submitted to Biological Conservation "A meta-analysis of the faunal recovery during secondary forest succession in the tropics"
This code was created by Orlando Acevedo-Charry, based in several "bloggers" and resource online, and with the encouragment of Zuania Colon and advise of Mitch Aide. Thank you so much!! 
There are 16 scripts for different analysis-figures. For each script there is included the packages used. Each script will run with the file "MainData.csv", but the "figure script" run with the results of the bootstraps (csv). Have fun!
